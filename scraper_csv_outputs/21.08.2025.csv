The Certificate of Incorporation was issued on August 21, 2025. This move is likely part of the company's strategy to expand or streamline its food-related operations, possibly focusing on quick commerce or rapid food delivery.

10-minute food delivery expansion:Eternal is expanding its 10-minute food delivery under the ""Bistro"" brand with 38 kitchens in Bengaluru and Delhi-NCR.

The stock's performance compared to the sector and Sensex, coupled with a high Debt to EBITDA ratio and reported losses, may have contributed to this. Despite this, the stock has shown strong growth over the past month and three years.

Analyst ratings and target prices:Some analysts have increased Eternal's share price target due to rapid quick commerce growth and anticipated better margins. However, other analysts have raised concerns about structural challenges and the likelihood of profitability.

MSCI reshuffle impacts:The latest MSCI Global Standard Index reshuffle is estimated to result in a $571 million outflow for Eternal.

Annual General Meeting (AGM) resolutions:At the 15th AGM on August 19, 2025, shareholders approved the re-appointment of Deloitte Haskins & Sells as statutory auditors and Chandrasekaran Associates as secretarial auditors. The re-appointment of Sanjeev Bikhchandani as Non-Executive Nominee Director was also approved.

GST demand order:Eternal received a GST demand order for ₹14.76 crore plus penalty for the 2020-21 financial year from Uttar Pradesh tax authorities regarding alleged short payment of tax. Eternal intends to appeal the order, believing it has a strong case and expects no financial impact.

NTPC Green Energy, a subsidiary, has commissioned new renewable energy projects in Gujarat, adding significant solar and wind capacity and increasing the NTPC Group's total installed capacity. Separately, NTPC Renewable Energy Limited (NTPC REL) was selected for a large Green Ammonia capacity in a SECI auction.

Financially, NTPC's Q1 standalone net profit rose despite a decline in revenue. NTPC Green Energy also reported strong Q1 results with increased net profit and revenue. The company's leadership remains consistent with the proposed re-appointment of the Chairman & Managing Director.

NTPC shares were under scrutiny on August 21, 2025, due to the renewable energy developments. The stock's performance showed a recent return and a lower correlation to market movements. Analyst ratings for NTPC include a ""Neutral"" rating from Motilal Oswal and a ""Buy"" rating from ICICI Securities.

It's important to distinguish NTPC Limited from RRB NTPC, which is a recruitment exam. Information related to the latter has been excluded to focus on the energy company."

On August 21, 2025, several updates related to Tata Steel emerged:

Recent news indicates that a proposed anti-dumping duty on steel imports from Vietnam could benefit Indian steel producers including Tata Steel. However, the CEO of Tata Steel noted a delay in the breakeven point for Tata Steel UK due to the tariff war.

In the last quarter, the company reported a net profit of ₹2,077.68 Crores and declared a dividend of ₹4.00 per share over the past year, resulting in a 2.22% dividend yield.

Tata Steel plans to invest ₹16,000 crore in capital expenditure for the fiscal year 2025, with around 75% allocated to expanding capacity in India, particularly at the Kalinganagar plant. The remaining funds are designated for the UK decarbonisation program. India's domestic steel demand is projected to grow by 8-10% annually, and Tata Steel aims to double its Indian capacity to 40 million tonnes per annum (MTPA). This expansion includes increasing capacity at Kalinganagar and Neelachal Ispat Nigam Ltd (NINL), establishing a new electric arc furnace (EAF) plant in Chandigarh, and expanding the Meramandali plant.

In the UK, one blast furnace at Port Talbot will close by June-end, and the second by September. The UK operations are expected to achieve positive EBITDA by Q3 FY25, supported by a planned equity injection of £2.1 billion from Tata Steel for debt repayment and restructuring. Netherlands operations are projected to be EBITDA positive by FY26.

Tata Steel also signed an MoU with IIT Bhubaneswar and India Accelerator for a startup program, published an Environmental Product Declaration for flat steel products, dispatched the first batch of galvanized coils from a new line in Kalinganagar, and achieved a production milestone at its Hooghly Met Coke plant.

Overall, Tata Steel is focusing on expanding its domestic capacity and improving environmental performance while navigating challenges in its international operations."

These layoffs are primarily affectingmid-level and senior employees, particularly in the people management layer, due to a perceived redundancy in their skills as technology advances,according to The Hindu.

The Union of IT & ITES Employees (UNITE) claims the actual number of layoffs is significantly higher, possibly reaching 30,000 to 40,000.

UNITE staged protests in Chennai and other cities, accusing TCS of targeting experienced employees while hiring fresh graduates at lower salaries, and planning to take the protest global if their demands are not met.

TCS, however, dismissed the claims of large-scale layoffs, reiterating that the workforce reduction is limited to 2% and that it is providing severance and transition support to affected employees.

TCS share price was trading at ₹3,089.10 on August 21, 2025, a 0.27% decrease from the previous closing price.

The stock has experienced mixed performance in the short-term, being up 2.30% in the last week but down 2.16% in the last month.

Over the past year, TCS has faced a decline of 31.30%.

The TCS layoffs have fueled concerns about the impact of AI on jobs in the IT sector, particularly for mid-to-senior level employees who may need to reskill to adapt to the changing technological landscape.

On August 21, 2025, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) was in the news primarily due to employee layoffs and related protests ."
