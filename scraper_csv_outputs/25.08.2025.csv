US Fed rate cut hopes:The surge in IT stocks, including Infosys, was linked to remarks by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinting at a possible interest rate cut in September 2025.

Strong Q1 earnings:For the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, Infosys reported a net profit of ₹6,921 crore and revenue of ₹42,279 crore, beating analyst expectations. This performance led the company to distribute a higher-than-average performance bonus to eligible employees.

Revised guidance:The company also raised its revenue guidance for FY26 to 1–3% growth, with AI-led initiatives expected to drive second-half growth.

As of August 25, 2025, Infosys (INFY) shares rallied, driven by positive market sentiment surrounding potential US Federal Reserve interest rate cuts .

The stock was reported to be near its 52-week low price of ₹391.50.

Analysts' commentary:An independent analyst suggested that the ITC stock was ""slightly bullish and oversold"" on daily charts, with a strong support level at ₹396.

Price targets:A close above the resistance of ₹403 could potentially lead to a target of ₹421 in the near term.

Sell rating initiated:The brokerage firm JM Financial initiated a ""Sell"" rating on the newly demerged ITC Hotels.

Reasoning for sell rating:JM Financial cited ""stretched valuations"" and ""restricted near-term growth"" for its rating.

Growth expectations:The brokerage believes that growth will be constrained as no new owned assets are expected to be commissioned until the financial year 2028.

Valuation perspective:JM Financial also noted that current valuations for ITC Hotels are trading at around 30 times its estimated FY27 earnings, which is viewed as adequately pricing in the company's future growth potential.

Target price:The brokerage set a target price of ₹215 for ITC Hotels, representing a potential 12% downside from the day's trading levels.

Expansion plans:Despite the bearish rating on valuation, JM Financial acknowledged that ITC Hotels has an asset-light pipeline with a long-term goal of reaching over 200 hotels and 20,000 keys by 2030.

News related to ITC on August 25, 2025, primarily focused on stock market performance and the analysis of its recently demerged hotel business ."

Reasoning: The current prohibition forces companies to rely on non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) or bonds to finance such deals. Setty suggested starting with large, transparently traded listed companies.

Context: The request comes as corporate lending by banks has slowed, while public sector banks collectively reported record profits in the first quarter of FY26.

Key development: A memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed between SBI and VinFast Auto India to offer retail car financing for electric vehicles (EVs).

Details: The partnership will provide customers with flexible financing options, including attractive interest rates and potential 100% on-road funding. Dedicated SBI representatives will be available at VinFast showrooms across India.

Legal action against Anil Ambani: The CBI filed a criminal case against Anil Ambani after an SBI complaint alleged a wrongful loss of ₹2,930 crore due to misrepresentation in sanctioning credit facilities.

Bank holiday: Banks in Assam were closed on August 25 for Tirubhav Tithi, while branches in the rest of India remained open.

Procurement tenders: The bank published several new tender notices for branch premises across various regions, including Maharashtra, Lucknow, and Chennai.

Share price: SBIN shares moved up slightly on August 25, with Livemint reporting a 0.09% increase to ₹816.80 at one point.
