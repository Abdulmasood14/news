Bajaj Auto has resumed supplies of its Chetak electric scooter across all dealerships after resolving a shortage of rare earth magnets. Production and shipments restarted on August 20, 2025, allowing the company to return to full capacity. Bajaj Auto has secured enough stock of materials for the upcoming festive season. Earlier, Bajaj Auto Managing Director Rajiv Bajaj had indicated the possibility of zero production in August due to the magnet shortage.

Bajaj Auto shares saw gains on August 22, 2025, following the announcement of resumed Chetak supplies. Shares were trading at ₹8,707 apiece on the National Stock Exchange, a gain of 0.26%.

Bajaj Auto Credit Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bajaj Auto, issued its first commercial paper valued at Rs. 500 crore on August 18, 2025. The paper, rated Crisil A1+, has a 6.25% discount rate and a 91-day tenure. This marks the subsidiary's entry into the short-term debt market.

Bajaj Auto reported a 14% year-on-year increase in consolidated profit after tax (PAT) to ₹2,210 crore in the first quarter ending June 30, 2025. Revenue from operations also rose by 10% YoY to ₹13,133 crore. This growth was attributed to strong performance in exports, premium motorcycles, commercial vehicles, and the Chetak EV segment.

Data from the VAHAN portal for the first 21 days of August 2025 shows Ather with a 17% market share, placing Bajaj Auto at number 5 with 12%. TVS Motor Company held the top spot with 25%, while Ola Electric was third with 16%. Bajaj Auto's drop from its usual 20% market presence is seen as temporary, with potential for increased sales towards the end of August due to the start of the Ganpati festival. The electric 2-wheeler market remains competitive, with monthly sales near 1,00,000 units."

Grasim Industries shares saw a significant decline today, falling 2.55% and closing at ₹2,807.80. This makes it one of the top losers on the Nifty 50 index today.

The stock was down by 2.21% at 3:10 PM, trading at ₹2,817.40, underperforming the benchmark Nifty 50 index which was down by 0.85%.

This decline is attributed to short-term profit booking after the stock touched a near 52-week high yesterday.

However, Grasim's stock has shown positive long-term trends, with a 3.33% gain in the past month and a 15.20% gain year-to-date, outperforming the Nifty 50 index.

Trading volume for Grasim Industries was high today, exceeding the weekly average, indicating significant market activity.

Grasim Industries posted record revenue numbers for the quarter ending June 2025 (₹40,118 crore) and for the fiscal year 2025 (₹1,48,478 crore).

Despite this, net profit for the year ending March 2025 saw a decline to ₹7,459.54 crore from ₹9,836.97 crore in the previous year.

Grasim Industries is currently evaluating an order from the District Magistrate of Sonebhadra, Uttar Pradesh, regarding an alleged underpayment of stamp duty on a 2011 acquisition.

The order demands ₹8.66 crore, including differential stamp duty, interest, and a penalty.

Grasim Industries is considering challenging the order before the appropriate authorities.
